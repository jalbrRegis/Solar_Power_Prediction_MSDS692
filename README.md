##Introduction
Solar power has long been a source for clean energy for residential and commercial properties but weighing the high installation cost against long term gains can be speculative and cumbersome. For this project weather data and solar data will be used combined with locational data to predict solar power generation. One can use the application to select a prospective area for solar installation and then predict how much energy can be produced. Homeowners and businesses can use the application to determine their brake even point and can use the predictions to understand how much energy they can expect from solar. With many corporations having “Go Green” initiatives it can also assist in estimating the cost of going carbon neutral. In all, estimating solar output would be helpful for anyone looking to reduce their carbon footprint but also ensuring energy and cost needs will be met in the future.
